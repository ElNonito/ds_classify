I choosed Audio classification: crema_d  |  TensorFlow Datasets. Guess the sentiment(s) of the given speech sequence, among 6 possible labels
From P5A return of experience I know the hardest part won't be applying the model it self.
The data will be easier to manage as it comes from tensor flow library.
First plan is to explore the data. Make a base line model if easy. Either case read about audio classification.

Practical tools I set up :
* Lazy git (add commit push in one line)
* Lazy time stamp : insert timestamp in file on Maj + F5
